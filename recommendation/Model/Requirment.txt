Here’s a requirements text that you can provide to the frontend developer, outlining what’s needed for the integration of the machine learning model and the doctor suggestion algorithm:

### Requirements for Frontend Developer

#### Project Overview
This project involves integrating a machine learning model for disease prediction with a doctor suggestion algorithm. The backend components are already implemented, and we need the frontend to interact seamlessly with these components.

#### Files to be Used
1. **`Doctor_data_with_diseases.csv`**: This file contains the data about doctors, including their specialties and associated diseases.
2. **`integrate_algo_model.py`**: This script integrates the machine learning model with the doctor suggestion algorithm, handling input from the frontend and returning relevant outputs.
3. **`Suggest_doctor_algo.py`**: This file contains the logic for suggesting doctors based on the disease predicted by the model.
4. **`svc.pkl`**: This is the saved trained model (Support Vector Classifier) that will be used for predicting diseases.
5. **`Training_in_notebook.ipynb`**: This Jupyter notebook contains the training process for the machine learning model. While the model is already trained and saved, this notebook serves as documentation for the training process.

#### Frontend Requirements
1. **Input Form**:
   - Create a user-friendly form where users can input their symptoms. This form should handle user input and send it to the backend.
   - The symptoms should be processed into a format compatible with the model (e.g., using the symptoms dictionary).

2. **Model Integration**:
   - The frontend should make an API call to `integrate_algo_model.py` to send user input (symptoms).
   - Ensure the input is sent in a JSON format as required by the backend.

3. **Display Results**:
   - After receiving predictions from the backend, display the predicted disease(s) to the user.
   - Based on the predicted disease, call the doctor suggestion algorithm (`Suggest_doctor_algo.py`) to retrieve relevant doctors.
   - Show the doctor details (name, specialty, experience, etc.) to the user in a clear and accessible format.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement error handling to manage situations where the input symptoms do not match any disease in the model.
   - Provide user feedback for incorrect or invalid input.

5. **Styling and Responsiveness**:
   - Ensure the UI is visually appealing and responsive across different devices.
   - Use CSS frameworks (like Bootstrap) for better design and responsiveness.

6. **Testing**:
   - The frontend should be thoroughly tested to ensure that all components work together seamlessly.
   - Make sure to test edge cases and ensure the application handles them gracefully.

#### Additional Considerations
- Documentation should be provided for the frontend code to ensure maintainability.
- Keep in communication with the backend developer to clarify data formats and any changes in the API.
